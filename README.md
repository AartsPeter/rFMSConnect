# rFMSConnect
Welcome,

This repository contains the front-end application of the POC called 'rFMSConnect'.
The POC environment was created during my work at DAF Connect as part of creating a playground with DAF Connect data based on the rFMS-standard. The rFMS-Standard was created on initiatieve of the ACEA to ensure a standard for exchanging OEM vehicle data between OEM's and customers with their services.

The POC environment consists of two main parts, the rFMS-API-ETL and the rFMSConnect.
